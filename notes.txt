what types of graphs can we do a topological sort?

A directed acylic graph 

Difference btween topological sort and DFS? 

DFS prints vertex and moves on to the next child. Top sort also considers other vertices that don't have incomming edges. Those vertices should come before vetices with incoming edges.

What data structure is used to assist with a topological sort algorithm?

A directed acyclic graph
